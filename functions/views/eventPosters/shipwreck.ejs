							Convincing someone is always hard, but here is your
							chance to our judge to give you the spare lifejacket
							and save yourself from the sinking ship!
							<br />
							<br />
							Shipwreck is a fun game which provides you with a
							hypothetical scenario where the participants are
							famous personalities stuck in a sinking ship ,but
							there are only 2 life jackets, the judges aka the
							captain of the ship only has one extra, so it is
							your job to convince him to give you the extra life
							jacket, with jokes, voice mimics , portraying
							specific character traits and good punchlines. If
							you impress the captain, you win!<br /><br />

							It’s a game of life and death! All the best!<br />
